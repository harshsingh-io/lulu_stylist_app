**System Design for the AI Stylist Flutter App**

---

**Introduction**

The AI Stylist App aims to provide users with personalized fashion advice through an interactive AI chat interface, manage their wardrobe digitally, and handle user details for enhanced personalization. We'll design a Flutter app that efficiently integrates these features while ensuring a seamless user experience, robust backend integration, and adherence to privacy standards.
